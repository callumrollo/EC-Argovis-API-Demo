## Demonstration of Argovis Python API - Adapted for Binder after Argovis hsackthon June 2020

You can run these notebooks using your own Jupyter kernel. 

The notebooks use some libraries that can take time to set up on some systems (e.g. Cartopy).

I (Callum) have taken Tyler Tucker's notebooks and made a binder-friendly environment for them, so you can enjoy Argovis from the comfort of your browser. Just click the "launch binder" button at the top of this readme.
